# Social Media Template

This is a **static social media website template** built using **HTML, CSS**, and basic frontend design techniques.  
I created this project as part of my learning practice to improve my web development and UI design skills.

The template includes multiple pages commonly found in social media platforms, such as feeds, profile pages, and edit profile forms.
